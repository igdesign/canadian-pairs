5. Play will be foreshortened or cancelled in these cases:
5. + In the event of inclement weather ie thunder or lightning, play may be suspended by the sounding of a siren or horn. Players should mark their ball in the position as it lies and return to the clubhouse.
5. + The tournament director or tournament organizer may declare a result for the competition over the total number of holes completed by all competitors.

6. The tournament director or tournament organizer may authorize the re-siting of a hole or holes if the course becomes waterlogged during play.

7. The first points of contact for any ruling are the tournament officials. Should recourse to the tournament referee be necessary, this will be undertaken by the tournament officials.

8. Any unsettled disputes shall be settled by the competition committee (three to form a quorum) whose decision shall be final.

9. The competition shall be played in accordance with the rules of golf as laid down by Golf Canada together with any local rules approved by the event competition committee.

10. All competitors must play with golf balls that conform with the Golf Canada current list of conforming balls.

11. Should one half of the attending winning pair be unable to compete in, or complete the final and be replaced, only the remaining original player's score will count.

12. Any competitor, who during the course of an event misbehaves by, for example, swearing, throwing clubs, or vandalizing the golf course or club house, or acts in any manner which might bring the game into disrepute, may be debarred from entering or taking part in any event for such period as the committee may decide. Prize winners who do not stay for the presentation will forfeit their prize, unless due to extenuating circumstances, and prior authorization has been given by the tournament director.

13. Canadian Pairs reserves the right to make any amendments to these rules that it deems necessary.
