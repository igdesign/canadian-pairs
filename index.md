The Canadian Pairs Presented By WestJet offers any Golf Club in the country the chance to host a tournament, where the entrants compete for the chance to play in their Regional Finals. Where they will win the chance to fly out to Crown Isle Golf & Country Club, to participate in the Final.

Over the past seven years, the Canadian Pairs Presented By WestJet has developed what we feel is the best tournament value and experience in Western Canada.

Where else can a club send a team of two average golfers on an all-expense paid trip to Crown Isle Resort to compete for the chance to then play a tournament at fabled Pebble Beach?

Still where The Canadian Pairs Presented By WestJet really separates is in the attention to detail and commitment to ensuring that the competitors have a great time.
